# Divorce-Case-Prediction-using-machine-learning-models
As the number of divorce cases are increasing very
rapidly all over the world. Even in the last few decades, the
number of divorces has gone up from 1 to 13 out of 1000
in India only. Due to this reason, it may be a major concern
for a marriage counsellor or a therapist. Therefore, we need
an effective divorce prediction technique that helps a marriage
counsellor or a therapist to identify the basic reason behind it.
In this work, we present a study on divorce cases prediction
using the existing machine learning models. We have applied
the Perceptron classifier, Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest
classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour classifier
and Support Vector Machine classifier for prediction of divorce
cases, and determine the best level of accuracy by comparing
these models. The criteria employed in this study make use of
Gottman method to make the predictions. We have achieved the
highest accuracy of 98.5% with the Perceptron model.
